;; All of the above can be customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET sysadmin RET

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put sysadmin.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
